# Linear Algebra

Hi! I'm trying to re-learn linear algebra, and am curious about numpy. In the following repository you will find the scripts that I have been using to teach myself both. This is more of a personal and educational project.

## Installation

In order to run the script numpy and matplotlib are needed. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install them.

## Scripts
Vector_plot.py
```
Sets a window pane with two vectors and its sum. Proof of concept of what can be done with Vectors and matplotlib.
```
